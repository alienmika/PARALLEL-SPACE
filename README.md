# PARALLEL-SPACE
Parallel Space : Parallel Space  ( http://www.parallel-space.com/ ) is an application that lets you manage two user accounts for each application installed on Android devices. Basically, you can create two different accounts for any app like Facebook, Instagram, Clash of the Clans, Candy Crush Saga, etc.  Parallel Space is much simpler than you might expect. Basically, this application creates virtual space that is completely detached and separated in the device so you can run other applications in it. Thus, you can use the same application twice on the same device. One app runs on the device, another in Parallel Space.  Feature List: The list of nice features of Parallel Space is the small amount of memory needed, just over 2 MB. Not only that, this app also does not require root so it will work on any Android device. However, Parallel Space requires a lot of permissions that all applications use.  Parallel Space is a very interesting app. With Parallel Space, you can use different accounts for different applications on the device at the same time. This feature will be very useful for social networking and playing games.
